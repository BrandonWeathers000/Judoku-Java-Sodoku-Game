# Judoku-Java-Sodoku-Game
#### Author: Brandon Weathers

This is a simple sudoku game written in java.

Need to work on:
- A way for the user to select a certain cell and change it

Issues:
- I feel there is a better way to write the checkRow and checkColumn method in the Grid class. I cannot find a better way, help would be greatly appreciated.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions.
